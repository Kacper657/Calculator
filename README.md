🔍 Requirements:
- 🖥 Operating system: Windows
- 🛠 Environment: C++ Builder. The code was originally written in Borland's version of C++ Builder, so it's best to use that version to compile and run your project. However, the code may also work in newer versions of C++ Builder from Embarcadero, but this has not been tested.

🚀 Installation:
1. Environment: Make sure you have C++ Builder installed.
2. Downloading the project: Clone the repository with Git:
git clone (https://github.com/Kacper657/Test)
3. Opening the project: Open the project file (most likely with the extension .cbproj or .bpr) in C++ Builder.
4. Build: In the C++ Builder environment, build the project by selecting the appropriate option (for example, "Build").
5. Run: After successful compilation, you can run the application directly from C++ Builder.****
